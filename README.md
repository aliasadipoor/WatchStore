# WatchStore
 Hello!
This is a mobile e-commerce application developed using the Flutter framework, specifically designed for selling various types of watches. The app features a modern, beautiful, and user-friendly interface, providing a smooth and engaging user experience. Users can easily browse through products, view detailed watch listings, and add items to their shopping cart.

The app is built using Clean Architecture, ensuring a scalable, testable, and maintainable structure. For state management, the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern is implemented, allowing for precise and efficient control of the app's behavior in complex scenarios.## About ME
I use my technical skills and front-end experience and am always looking for new ways to improve the user experience (UX). I believe that a front-end developer should use his skills to understand the needs of users in the best possible way.
In addition to technical skills, I also teach communication skills and important tasks. I believe that a Frand programmer should communicate well with users and other team members
